# TensorBoard Logging Example

## Overview

TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool provided by TensorFlow for tracking and visualizing various aspects of the training process, including model metrics, loss, and more. This example demonstrates how to log training information to TensorBoard.

## Steps:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Import the required libraries, including TensorFlow and any other relevant libraries for your model.

2. **Model Definition**: Define your machine learning model. In this example, we assume you have a model named `model`.

3. **TensorBoard Callback**: Use the `TensorBoard` callback provided by TensorFlow to log information during training. This callback will create log files that TensorBoard can read.

4. **Training Configuration**: Set up your model training configuration, including the dataset, optimizer, loss function, etc.

5. **Fit Model with TensorBoard Callback**: When fitting the model, pass the `TensorBoard` callback to the `callbacks` parameter.

6. **Run TensorBoard**: After training, launch TensorBoard in your terminal using the command `tensorboard --logdir=path_to_your_logs`. Open the provided URL in your web browser to visualize training metrics.
